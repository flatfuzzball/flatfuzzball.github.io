<li>Powerful file archiver with a high compression ratio.</li>
<li>" It's like geocities. I mean, it's what I used to make this site. I recommend you donate if you're able to."</li>
<li>" It's like uTorrent but good. Faster, open source, no ads, just good torrenting software. No, torrenting is not illegal."</li>

<h3 id="templogarchives">Templog Archives.</h3>
<p>"The temporary log was used between 19/1/23 and 21/1/23, before I was able to set up a proper logs page."</p>
<p>"Temporary log: 19/1/23: Site Created. Has a simple homepage, logo, WIP text. 20/1/23: Added navbar with new recommendations page. Changed font to Press Start 2P, added light blue background. Updated home page to mention navbar, created the temporary log. Will add a better system tomorrow. 21/1/23: Added some badges, will make a proper log once I manage to get out of bed."</p>
